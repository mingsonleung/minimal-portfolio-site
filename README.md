# Minimal Portfolio Site

This is a revised portfolio site with a focus on performance and minimalism. The previously overdesigned portfolio site can be seen here: [Portfolio | Mingson Leung](https://mingson.dev/)

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `css/`: Folder for CSS files.
- `js/`: Folder for JavaScript files.
- `assets/`: Folder for images, fonts, and documents.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the page.
3. Modify the files in `css/` and `js/` as needed.

## Version Control

Use Git for version control. Here are some basic commands:

- `git init`: Initialize a new repository.
- `git add .`: Stage all changes.
- `git commit -m "Initial commit"`: Commit the changes.
- `git push origin main`: Push the changes to the remote repository.
